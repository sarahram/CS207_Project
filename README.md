# Audio Spectrum Visualizer 

This Audio Spectrum Visualizer takes in sound from the external environment, measures the frequency, and sets off lights based on the readings. We were inspired to do this project based on our interest in music, as well as other projects we found such as a Music Reactive LED Strip with Amplifier. Our design uses an arduino genuino uno, a microphone amplifier, 4 LEDs, and resistors, and is a great project for anyone at the beginner level. This project is entirely customizable as you can use any amount/colours of LEDs, thresholds for frequencies that control the lights, how the lights are displayed, and more.

# Usage 

* Build the circuit
* Connect Arduino to a computer
* Install Arduino application (if not already have)
* Upload the code
* Play music 
* Enjoy the lights!

# Team

All members participated in brainstorming and additional research and changes to the write up as needed.

The build team consists of:
* Sarah Ram -- Focused mainly on the GitHub assembly and curation, formatting this readme file as well as the files themselves. Also,     was able to create a schematic and breadboard view of the circuit built to include in this readme file.
* Mackenzy Vida -- Focused on Documentation and write up of this project, as well as ordering the required material and assembling it to   make our light display look nice and presentable.  
* Lauren Wilson -- Focused on the documentation as well as the GitHub information.
* Chase Wilson -- Focused on assembling and altering the code and the main build of the circuit.
