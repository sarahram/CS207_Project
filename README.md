# Team

All members participated in brainstorming and additional research and changes to the write up as needed.

The build team consists of:
* Sarah Ram -- Focused mainly on the GitHub assembly and curation, formatting this readme file as well as the files themselves. Also,     was able to create a schematic and breadboard view of the circuit built to include in this readme file.
* Mackenzy Vida -- Focused on Documentation and write up of this project, as well as ordering the required material and assembling it to   make our light display look nice and presentable.  
* Lauren Wilson -- Focused on the documentation as well as the GitHub information.
* Chase Wilson -- Focused on assembling and altering the code and the main build of the circuit.
